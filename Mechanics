_______________________________________
Coding process:
1. Do game progression first
    # - make a character input on what the character name is
    # - make a character with health and enemy with health
    # - provide winning conditions
    # - make them attack each other
2. Add the next wave of enemies
    # - then the next wave
    # - adjust the attack and health of enemies
    - provide rule that everytime you win, you regain back 
        only your health #optimize - add shit like wow you 
        #gained health
3. define skills
    - Int, Dex, Str
    - add stamina in character stats
    - add magic attack and normal attack in options
        - make magic attack minus some stamina
        - make heal minus some stamina
        - stamina cant be used when current stamina < magic 
            mana
4. add leveling up
    - provide rule that everytime you win, you level up.
        - 1 point for each normal enemy
        - 2 points for each harder enemy
    - every time you level up, choose to increase Int, Dex, 
        or Str by 1
        - provide calculations on how Int, Dex, Str affects 
            Stamina, HP and heal, and ATK increase
5. Test the shit and debug
6. Add main menu 
    - Play
    - Statistics
        - put the name input to stats
        - click play and play time++
        - if boss hp dead, complete game++
        - return main menu
    - Exit
